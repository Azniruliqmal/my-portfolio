# Aznirul Iqmal â€“ Portfolio


This portfolio showcases my work and skills through a clean and modern user interface. The website is organized into distinct sections accessible via the top navigation bar: "About," "Projects," "Experience," and "Contact."

The "Projects" section highlights a few of my recent works, each with a brief description and the technologies used, such as Python, Vue, and TypeScript. Some project cards also include a video thumbnail and a "View Code" button, providing a quick look into the project and a link to the codebase. The "Experience" section presents a chronological overview of my professional and internship history. Each entry includes the job title, company, dates, and a clear, bulleted list of my key responsibilities and accomplishments.

Finally, the "Contact" page provides multiple ways for visitors to reach out. It features a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message. Additionally, it offers direct links to my email, LinkedIn, and resume for a more personal connection.
