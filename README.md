# Aznirul Iqmal â€“ Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects. It's a modern, interactive single-page application built with React (Vite + TS), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion and Lottie.

## Features
- Interactive Hero Section: The landing page features a unique "glassmorphism" hero section with animated radial gradients and a micro-interactive call-to-action button, adding a dynamic and modern feel.
- Engaging UI/UX: I've incorporated subtle Lottie micro-interactions to bring elements to life and used scroll-based motion reveals to make content appear as you navigate the page.
- User-Centric Design: The website includes a dark/light theme toggle that persists based on your system preferences, providing a comfortable viewing experience for all users.
- Scalable Architecture: Project details are managed using a JSON-based content system, which makes it easy to add new projects and could even be extended to a full Content Management System (CMS) in the future.
- Privacy-Friendly Analytics: I've implemented a plausible analytics script to ensure that user tracking is handled in a privacy-conscious way.
- Accessibility: The site is built with accessible, semantic HTML and carefully managed focus states to ensure a great experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Tech Stack
 - Front-end: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lottie, and Zustand (for global state management).
 - Routing: React Router.
