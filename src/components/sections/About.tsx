        Nothing much about me, just a person with highly motivated and adaptable individual with a passion for continuous learning and innovation. I am a Bachelor's degree graduate in Information Management, and I recently completed the Full-Stack AI Development program at Gamuda AI Academy to further my skills in artificial intelligence.

        My technical expertise spans across both front-end and back-end development, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, React, and Python, which I have applied in developing full-stack applications during my studies. I focus on designing thoughtful interaction patterns, elevating products with purposeful motion, and collaborating across disciplines to ship inclusive, performant interfaces. With a background in both design and development, I create seamless user experiences that bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.

        I enjoy staying active and competitive through sports like football, table tennis, golf, and badminton. I also express my creative side by playing instruments such as the guitar and keyboard, and I find a balance between work and life by enjoying games. These hobbies have taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and a well-rounded perspective.
